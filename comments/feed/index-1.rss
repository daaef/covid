					<description><![CDATA[I want to personally appreciate members of the PTF on COVID 19.Your assignment I must say is a thankless one.
However, I want to appeal to the PTF not to be tired in singing, shouting and appealing to Nigerians to be more responsible by taking this issue of COVID 19 with all seriousness.
Furthermore, I recognize the important role of the Media, but, listening to some of the questions asked, one could say, with humility, that some of them are asking questions that are not relevant to the briefing. For instance, one of them ask a question relating to the Albino Foundation and palliatives to them. The question is &quot;Must Government do everything&quot;?.The foundation can do something to its members.
Once again, I say thank you to you all and I pray God will reward your labour of love.]]></description>
